# Project Nexus: ProDev Backend Engineering Documentation

Welcome to **Project Nexus**, a documentation hub that captures my learning journey through the **ProDev Backend Engineering** program. This repository showcases the skills, tools, and backend engineering principles I have acquired and applied across multiple weeks of hands-on learning.

---

## ðŸš€ Program Overview

The **ProDev Backend Engineering Program** is an intensive, project-based learning track aimed at equipping learners with modern backend development skills. Over 12 weeks, I explored foundational to advanced backend technologies, practiced industry-standard workflows, and built real-world backend services.

## ðŸ§  Major Learnings

### ðŸ”§ Key Technologies Covered

- **Python**: Core language used throughout, including advanced features like decorators, context managers, and asynchronous programming.
- **Django**: Main framework for building RESTful APIs, handling database interactions, middlewares, signals, and advanced ORM.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Used to create robust, secure, and well-documented APIs.
- **GraphQL**: Integrated with Django for flexible API querying and mutation.
- **Docker**: Used for containerizing applications and environments.
- **Kubernetes**: Introduced for orchestration of Docker containers.
- **CI/CD**: Implemented Continuous Integration and Deployment using **Jenkins** and **GitHub Actions**.
- **Redis**: Utilized for caching and performance improvements.
- **Celery & Celery Beat**: Scheduled tasks, background jobs, and asynchronous processing.
- **Datadog, NewRelic, UptimeRobot, Nagios, WaveFront**: For application performance monitoring and alerting.

### ðŸ§± Backend Concepts Mastered

- **Database Design & Modeling**: Created normalized schemas, ERDs, seeders, and optimized SQL queries.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Utilized `asyncio`, asynchronous views, and task queues (Celery).
- **Caching Strategies**: Implemented caching layers using Redis; learned cache invalidation and hit-ratio monitoring.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Built secure login systems with JWT, session-based and token-based auth.
- **Middleware Logic**: Created custom middleware for request filtering, time-based restrictions, logging, and offensive language detection.
- **API Security**: Applied rate limiting, IP tracking, blacklisting, HTTPS with SSL Termination, and user activity logging.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Used Django Signals to trigger workflows like notifications and cleanup.
- **Testing**: Wrote unit tests, integration tests with `pytest`, and applied TDD principles.
- **Shell Scripting**: Automated deployment, server setup, and debugging tasks using Bash.
- **Container Orchestration**: Deployed apps on Kubernetes using Minikube, Ingress, blue-green deployments, and rolling updates.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Integrated tools like Datadog and NewRelic for observability.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated builds, tests, Docker image creation and deployment through Jenkins and GitHub Actions.

### Week 12: Capstone Project - Online Poll System
- Documented learning journey so far in my README.md file

### Week 13: Capstone Project - Online Poll System
#### âœ… Day 1â€“2: Setup & Models
- Bootstrapped a Django project for the online poll system.
- Set up project structure and version control (`.gitignore`, `.env`).
- Created database models: `User`, `Poll`, `Question`, `Choice`, and `Vote`.
- Registered models with the Django admin site.
- Applied initial migrations and verified model relationships.
- Secured secrets using `django-environ` and environment variables.

#### âœ… Day 3: Poll Management API
- Created DRF views for `Poll`, `Question`, and `Choice` models.
- Implemented endpoints for poll creation, listing, and detail view.
- Added functionality to create questions for polls and choices for questions.
- Ensured expired polls cannot be created (expiry validation).
- Responses include nested questions and choices for better client consumption.
- Tested all endpoints with Postman using token-based authentication.

#### âœ… Day 4: Voting Logic and Tests
- Added voting functionality to allow users to vote on poll choices.
- Implemented validation to prevent duplicate votes from the same IP or session.
- Integrated the voting route into the API.
- Wrote unit tests to cover vote submissions, duplicate prevention, and expired polls.
- Confirmed all tests pass with `python manage.py test`.

#### âœ… Day 5: Results & Admin Enhancements
- Built real-time poll result aggregation using Django ORM annotations.
- Enhanced the Django Admin with vote statistics per poll and question.
- Admins can now:
    1. View total votes per poll and per question.
    2. Sort and filter questions based on total vote counts.
    3. Download poll results as CSV with total votes and percentage breakdowns.
- Ensured proper formatting and UX on the Admin interface for managing results.

#### âœ… Day 6: Swagger API Documentation

- Installed and configured `drf-yasg` for interactive API documentation.
- Enabled public access to Swagger UI at `/api/docs/` without login.
- Annotated API views and viewsets with detailed descriptions and example payloads using `@swagger_auto_schema`.
- Documented all input/output fields and expected responses.

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices & Takeaways

- **Test Early, Test Often**: Testing isn't an afterthought; start with `pytest` from the beginning.
- **Write Reusable Code**: Use Python decorators and DRF ViewSets for clean, DRY code.
- **Document Everything**: Swagger, README.md, and comments aid collaboration.
- **Secure by Default**: Use HTTPS, sanitize inputs, restrict access.
- **Observe & Monitor**: Logs and metrics matter more than you thinkâ€”integrate APMs early.
- **Automate Repetitive Tasks**: Use Bash scripts, cron jobs, and Celery workers.
- **Keep Learning**: The backend world evolvesâ€”keep refining your toolkit.
